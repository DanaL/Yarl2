What is this?
Delve is a roguelike fantasy CRPG in tradition of nethack, Angband, and others. You will create a character who explores a deep dungeon seeking to defeat a terrible evil lurking in the depths.


Your first character will probably not succeed, and your second may not either. Delve, like many roguelikes, features permadeath: if your character is killed you will not be able to return to a previous save point and will have to begin a new game. But on the bright side, each time you create a character you will be presented with freshly generated world. The dungeon levels, the world above, and the village where you begin will all be a little bit different.
#
Movement
Delve is largely keyboard-driven and has many commands to control what your character is doing. You'll need to learn the movement keys. You may move around around using the clssic rogue/VIM-style keys, the arrow keys, or the number pad.
     
          North      Northwest Northeast
           |                 \  /
    West-hjkl-East           y u          b n
          |                              /   \
         South                   Southwest    Southeast

You can 'run' by pressing shift and any of the movement keys and your character will move automatically as far as they are able, stopping if they reach something interesting like items on the dungeon floor, or if a monster comes into view.

If you attempt to move into a closed door, you will automatically open it, and bumping into a monster makes a melee attack against them.
