Delve is a dungeon-crawling, traditional roguelike where you take the role of a novice adventurer come to an isolated village after hearing rumours of a looming evil threatening to overwhelm it.

This version of game should be considered pre-alpha, an early release to get feedback on the game systems and its so far. Currently, only the first two dungeons have content but the first dungeon should be a nice adventuring experience.
