Playing around with yet another rougelike. This time in C#, the programming language I probably know best.

On Windows I'm going to be using BearlibTerminal for display, and I am hoping to on macOS as well, although my initial stab at getting it to build on macOS failed. If I can't get it going, I use ncurses or something for Macs.
